\section{Overview}

Piezoelectric elements are defined as materials, such as crystals and certain ceramics or biological matter e.g. bones, DNA and protein which produce an electrical charge through mechanical stress. \\

    To understand how a piezoelectric element works, one must have a look at the structure of a piezoelectric crystal. Most piezoelectric elements are made from quartz. Quartz is a material composed of silicon-dioxide whose structure can be seen in Figure 1. It is made of silicone and oxygen atoms arranged in a hexagonal shape. The silicone atoms are charged positively and the oxygen atoms negatively as the oxygen atom has a higher electronegativity.\\

\begin{minipage}{0.66\textwidth}
    In the beginning the average position of the charges overlap with each other. This means that no electromagnetic field is formed and thus no electric charge flows. However, when mechanical stress is applied onto the crystal the structure is changed.\\

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.66\textwidth}
Mechanical stress can be either in the form of compression or expansion. In case of compression, the average position of the negative charge is moved upwards and the average position of the positive charge is moved downwards and vice versa when expanded.\\
\end{minipage}

In either way, a current can now flow as a positive face and a negative face is created. If a load such as a lightbulb is connected to the faces, the lightbulb would glow. It is important to note is that the load must be connected correctly. The anode and cathode differ depending on the type of mechanical stress.\\

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.66\textwidth}
    Besides the mechanical stress, a voltage can be applied onto the crystal. This is refered to as the reciprocal piezoelectric effect. When the cathode and anode are positioned like in  Figure \ref{fig:Quartzcell charged with a voltage} the crystal will be compressed since the anode repels the negatively charged oxygen and the cathode repels the positively charged silicone and vice versa.\\

\subsection{Formula}

To calculate the power output of the piezoelectric element, the voltage output has to be calculated. With the resistor attached to the piezoelectric element, the power output can be calculated. The formula for the voltage output of a piezoelectric element can be calculated by simplifying the voltage output of a capacitor since the piezoelectric element is a capacitor.\\
Before going through the process of simplifying the formula, two piezoelectric constants must be defined. There are many, however, only the electromechanical coupling factor and the piezoelectric voltage constant will be defined as only these constants will be used. The electromechanical coupling factor $d$ is defined as the effectiveness with which a piezoelectric element converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. The piezoelectric voltage constant $g$ is defined as the electric field generated by a piezoelectric element per unit stress applied. The constants differ depending on the direction of mechanical stress or the electrical field.\\

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.66\textwidth}
    The constants are marked with numbers. These numbers correspond to the direction of mechanical stress and the polarization which is depicted in Table \ref{Tab:Piezoelectric Constants} and Figure \ref{fig:Expansion Mode of the Piezoelectric Element}. In our case $g_{33}$ and $d_{33}$ will be used since the force acting on the crystal is from direction 3 and the polarization occurs in direction 3.\\

\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
    From Table \ref{Tab:Piezoelectric Constants}, one can see that the constant also depends on the type of piezoelectric material. There are three types of piezoelectric materials which are commonly used. The piezoelectric material used in this experiment is of type PZT-5J since the material was made from ceramic and the cathode was made from silver. This ensures that the piezoelectric element performs well under the specific stress and voltage. Depending on the direction, the type of piezo is chosen to maximise the power outcome. However, most piezos are of type PZT-5J since they are considered to be an allrounder for any case of stress or voltage.\\

Since the piezoelectric element is a capacitor, the formula $U=\frac{Q}{C}$ can be used where $U$ is the voltage, $Q$ is the charge and $C$ is the capacity. From there the formula $\epsilon \cdot \frac{A}{t}$ where $\epsilon$ is the permitivity, $A$ is the surface area where the mechanical stress is applied on and $t$ is the thickness of the piezoelectric element. Furthermore, the formula $d \cdot F$ can be inserted for $Q$ where $F$ is the force applied onto the piezoelectric element and $d$ is the effeciveness with wwhich a piezoelectric element converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. Once all equations are inserted, $U=\frac{d \cdot F \cdot t}{\epsilon \cdot A}$ where $\frac{d}{\epsilon}$ can be replaced with $g$. This results in the formula $U = g \cdot \frac{F \cdot t}{A}$ for the Voltage output of the piezoelectric element.
$$
U = \frac{Q}{C} \quad || \quad C = \epsilon \cdot \frac{A}{t} \text{ and } Q = d \cdot F
$$
$$
U = \frac{d \cdot F \cdot t}{\epsilon \cdot A} \quad || \quad g = \frac{d}{\epsilon}
$$
$$
U = g \cdot \frac{F \cdot t}{A}
$$
To calculate the power, the formula $P = R \cdot I^2$ can be used where $P$ is the power, $R$ is the resistance, and $I$ is the current. Since the current is unknown, it must be eliminated thus, $R \cdot I$ will be substituted with $V$ resulting in $P = V \cdot I$. Then $I$ will be substituted with $\frac{V}{R}$ resulting in the final formula $P = \frac{V^2}{R}$. With this formula the power output of the four piezoelectric elements can be calculated.
$$
P = R \cdot I^2 \quad || \quad V = R \cdot I
$$
$$
P = V \cdot I \quad || \quad I = \frac{V}{R} 
$$
$$
P = \frac{V^2}{R}
